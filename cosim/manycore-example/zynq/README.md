Make sure to update the makefile to point at wherever you have mapped the address of the accelerator using IPI. (See this [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U9XIxLkjbI1vQR5hxjk8SzqqQ3sM2hCMUXfoK3tGwBU/edit#.
).)

Note: you still use the Python3 Pynq environment and code to load the .bit file.

Read the Makefile comments to see what you can do in this directory!
