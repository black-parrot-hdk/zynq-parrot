Make sure to update the makefile to point at wherever you have mapped the address of the accelerator using IPI.

(See this [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U9XIxLkjbI1vQR5hxjk8SzqqQ3sM2hCMUXfoK3tGwBU/edit#.).)

Note: you still need to use the Python3 Pynq environment to load the bit file, but we provide a make rule for that.
